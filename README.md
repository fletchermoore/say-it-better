=============

Currently modeled after "Learning with texts" and minimally functional.

That is, it maintains a list of texts. You find a foreign text you are trying to learn and add it to the database.

When you view the text you have added, hyperlinks are added to each word. When you click a word, an external
dictionary (such as wordreference.com) is opened in an iframe. This allows you to rapidly translate a text.

You can add a word and its translation to a dictionary, which can be exported to the flashcard program of
your choosing.
